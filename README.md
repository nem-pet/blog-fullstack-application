Lightweight fullstack web application with a purpose of showcasing CRUD operations, as well as demonstrating use of ReactJS hooks, state management, Context, Router and Bootstrap on front-end side of the application. Back-end side of the application uses Java Spring Boot framework to connect database and front-end, with the help of entities and controllers and repositories. Database that was used in this project was PostgreSQL on a local machine. Video added showcases the project at work. Project itself functions as a web application blog where user can create an account, post a blog, delete their own blog, change their own account information as well see other user's posts.
